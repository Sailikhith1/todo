A simple and user-friendly To-Do web application built using Django as part of my learning journey. This project focuses on understanding Django’s core concepts such as models, views, URL routing, templates, and database interactions while implementing real-world CRUD functionality.

The application allows users to manage daily tasks efficiently with a clean and intuitive interface styled using Bootstrap.
